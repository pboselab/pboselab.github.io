# Join the Bose Lab

The Bose Lab welcomes curious, collaborative trainees who are excited about cancer biology, tumor immunology, and data‑driven translational research in head and neck cancer. The lab emphasizes rigor, openness, teamwork, and mentorship.

---

## Who we are looking for

We are a good fit for people who:
- Enjoy asking biological questions and thinking critically about evidence.
- Are motivated to learn (wet lab, computational, or hybrid skill sets).
- Communicate clearly and work well within a team.
- Value reproducibility and good scientific habits (documentation, version control, clean analysis).

## Open positions

### Graduate students (MSc / PhD)

Graduate projects typically focus on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and may include tumor immunology, spatial transcriptomics, single‑cell multi‑omics, and translational studies in patient cohorts.

**How to apply**
- Email **[pbose@ucalgary.ca](mailto:pbose@ucalgary.ca)** with:
  - CV
  - Unofficial transcript
  - A short paragraph describing your research interests and why you would like to join the lab
  - (Optional) Names of 1–2 references

---

### Postdoctoral fellows

We are interested in candidates with strong publication records and a clear, independent research vision. Experience in one or more of the following areas is an asset:
- Cancer immunology / T cell biology
- Spatial biology (e.g., Visium/HD, imaging, multiplex assays)
- Single‑cell multi‑omics (scRNA‑seq, CITE‑seq, TCR/VDJ)
- Computational biology, statistics, or machine learning applied to cancer data

**How to apply**
- Email **[pbose@ucalgary.ca](mailto:pbose@ucalgary.ca)** with:
  - CV
  - Brief statement of research interests (≤1 page)
  - 1–2 key papers or preprints you have contributed to
  - Names and contact information for references

---

### Undergraduate students / research assistants

We periodically have opportunities for motivated undergraduate students or research assistants to contribute to ongoing projects in molecular biology, immunology, and computational analysis.

**How to apply**
- Email **[pbose@ucalgary.ca](mailto:pbose@ucalgary.ca)** with:
  - CV
  - Your program, year, and availability (start date and hours/week)
  - A short note describing your interests and any relevant experience

---

## What to include in your email (quick checklist)

To help us review your application efficiently, please include:
- The position type (Undergraduate / MSc / PhD / Postdoc / RA)
- Your CV and anticipated start date / availability
- 2–5 sentences describing your research interests
- Any relevant skills (wet lab, coding, statistics, bioinformatics, etc.)
- Links (Google Scholar, GitHub, personal website, preprints), if available

---

## Equity, diversity, and inclusion

We aim to build a supportive environment where people from diverse backgrounds can do their best work. Applicants from equity‑deserving groups are strongly encouraged to apply, and candidates who require accommodations during the application process are invited to indicate this in their email.
