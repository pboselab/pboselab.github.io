## Who we are looking for
We are a good fit for people who:
- Enjoy asking biological questions and thinking critically about evidence
- Are motivated to learn (wet lab, computational, or hybrid)
- Communicate clearly and work well with a team
- Value reproducibility and good scientific habits (documentation, version control, clean analysis)
