<h1>Research</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
The Bose Lab investigates the biology and treatment vulnerabilities of <strong>head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)</strong> through integrated experimental, translational, and computational approaches.

  <h2>Theme 1: Oncogenic drivers and targeted therapy</h2>
  <p>This theme focuses on discovering and functionally validating oncogenic drivers and dependencies in HNSCC. The lab integrates genomic and transcriptomic profiling with in silico analyses to prioritize candidate oncogenes, followed by mechanistic studies in cell lines, three‑dimensional cultures, xenografts, and mouse models.</p>
  <p>Current work centers on targets such as <strong>RNF126</strong>, <strong>INHBA</strong>, <strong>PIAS1</strong>, and <strong>NCBP2</strong>, with an emphasis on defining their roles in tumor progression and treatment resistance and on developing rational combination strategies, including small‑molecule inhibitors and radiation‑based approaches.</p>

  <h2>Theme 2: Tumor immunity and immunotherapy in HNSCC</h2>
  <p>The second theme aims to delineate the immune landscape of HNSCC and to translate these insights into more effective immunotherapies. Ongoing efforts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Development of novel CAR‑based therapies for HNSCC</li>
    <li>Identification and validation of predictive biomarkers for PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade in recurrent or metastatic disease</li>
    <li>High‑resolution characterization of tumor‑infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune populations using single‑cell and multi‑omic technologies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These studies seek to understand mechanisms of immune evasion, refine patient selection for immunotherapy, and uncover combinatorial strategies that enhance anti‑tumor immunity.</p>

  <h2>Theme 3: AI‑enabled computational oncology</h2>
  <p>The third theme harnesses <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> to interpret complex molecular and imaging data in HNSCC and related malignancies. The lab is developing generative models to support and standardize digital pathology annotation, thereby improving the integration of histopathology with spatial and single‑cell datasets.</p>
  <p>In parallel, large‑scale machine‑learning and language‑model frameworks are being built to predict therapeutic perturbation responses and to guide precision treatment design, with the goal of translating multi‑modal data into clinically actionable decision support tools.</p>
